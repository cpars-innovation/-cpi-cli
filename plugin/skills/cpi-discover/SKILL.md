# Discover a tenant's conventions

Every tenant has its own house style. The other cpi skills (plan, build, test, review) follow
`.cpi/conventions.md` in the repository. This skill writes the first version of that file from
the flows that already exist. The user owns the file afterwards: they edit and extend it, and
you never overwrite their changes.

## 1. Check what is there

- If `.cpi/conventions.md` exists, this is a **refresh**: keep every section the user wrote or
  changed, only add new findings and mark contradictions (`> Discovery 2026-…: 14 of 20 new flows
  use X instead`). Ask before changing an existing rule.
- Ask the user which packages are representative if the tenant is large (more than ~50 flows) or
  contains SAP standard content that should not be copied (packages from the Discover catalogue,
  read-only packages). Standard content is a poor source for house conventions.

## 2. Collect the facts

Call `discover_tenant` (writes `.cpi/discovery.json` and `.cpi/graph.json`, returns the
summary). Use `package_ids` for the representative packages. If the repository already contains the content (e.g. from
`cpictl sync` or `snapshot`), `local_dir` analyses it offline.

The summary contains counts, not rules. Then **look at examples** to understand the why, about
5-8 flows chosen across packages and adapters:

- `list_resources` + `get_resource` for scripts that appear in several flows
  (`summary.sharedScripts`) and for the most common script names: they are usually the
  logging and error handling framework.
- `get_parameters` of a few flows: how are parameters named and grouped?
- `list_credentials`: how are credentials named (compare with `summary.credentialRefs`)?
- The graph shows how flows work together: `graph_search` with `types: ["endpoint"]` lists the
  ProcessDirect and JMS addresses (naming of internal interfaces), `graph_neighbors` on a
  common script or header shows which flows share it, `sends_to` edges show whether flows are
  split into inbound / processing / outbound parts.
- If the repository has downloaded flows, read one `.iflw` of a typical flow to see how the
  exception subprocess and the logging steps are built.

## 3. Write `.cpi/conventions.md`

Start from [conventions-template.md](conventions-template.md). For every rule:

- State it as an instruction ("Package IDs: `<Domain><System>`, e.g. `SDS4`"; package IDs allow letters and digits only).
- Give the evidence: how many flows follow it and one or two example IDs.
- Mark the strength: **rule** (≥ 80 % of the flows), **common** (≥ 50 %), **observed**
  (less, or contradicting variants). Never promote a minority pattern to a rule.
- Write "unknown" instead of guessing. Leave an `Open questions` entry for the user instead.

Keep it short and concrete (one to three screens). The plan, build and review skills read
it in every task.

Fill the **Templates** section with proposals (status `proposed`): per common pattern (sender
and receiver adapter combination in `summary.triggers` / the graph), the flow that best follows
the conventions you found: exception subprocess as usual, parameters externalised, shared
scripts used, `runtimeStatus` STARTED, no errors in discovery. Prefer flows the team names as
good examples. Never propose SAP standard content.

Also create, if missing:

- `.cpi/README.md`: one paragraph on what the folder is (see the template's footer).
- `.cpi/tests/` (empty, used by cpi-test).
- `.cpi/templates/scripts/`: after the user agreed, the shared logging and error handling
  scripts (`summary.sharedScripts`, read with `get_resource`), one file each, with a comment
  line naming the flows they were taken from. New flows copy them instead of writing new ones.

Do not commit discovery.json if the user does not want tenant inventory in Git; ask once and add
it to `.gitignore` when they say so.

## 4. Hand over

Show the user the proposed templates, the rules marked **observed** and the open questions, and ask them to confirm or
correct them. Apply their answers to the file. Tell them that they can add rules at any time
(for example "always set SAP_ApplicationID") and that the other skills will follow them.
